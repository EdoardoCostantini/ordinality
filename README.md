# Summary of project
The goal of the study was to understand how different ways of coding ordinal data impacts the quality of the low dimensional representation obtained by PCA.
The quality of the representation is assessed based on the prediction error obtained by using the PCs extracted based on the different coding schemes.

## Coding schemes compared

I compared the following coding schemes:

- **Original**: PCs are extracted from the original continuous data.
- **Ordinal treatment**:
  - **numeric**: PCs are extracted from the discretised version of the data (either on an interval or ordinal scale, depending on the condition), treated as continuous (ignores ordinal nature).
  - **ordinal**: PCs are extracted based on a modified correlation matrix computed with the assumption that the ordinal responses are made upon a continuously distributed trait and thresholds for categorical decision. Thus a measure of association between those continuous traits can be obtained, referred to as the polychoric correlation (tetrachoric correlation in the binary case). Then, classical factor analysis could be performed on the polychoric correlation.
- **Categorical treatment**:
  - **dummy**_ the PC is extracted from the design matrix with dummy codes from the discrete variables
  - **disjunction table**: the PC is extracted from the design matrix with cell means codes for the discrete variables (disjunction table). This method is also known as *Filmerâ€“Pritchett*.
  - **PCAmix / FAMD**: takes as input the original data, which, in most conditions, contains a mix of continuous and categorical variables, and treats the categorical ones with a special weighting matrix that deals with their categoricalness

## Simulation study procedure

The simulation study procedure involved:
1. Generation of X, the matrix of predictors. This happens based on a reverse SVD computation. 
   First, I defined the U, D, and V matrices.
   Then, I computed the true X matrix and added noise on top. 
2. Generation of y, the variable to be predicted. I generated the dependent variable as a linear combination of the true components with a target proportion of explained variance.
3. Discretization of X. Part of X is discretized to an ordinal item with a given number of categories.
4. PC extraction. Components are extracted from the partially discretised X.
5. The test MSE is computed for the model predicting y based on the PCs extracted.

## Simulation study experimental factors

The simulation study procedure is repeated for each of the conditions resulting by the crossing of the following experimental factors:

- **D**: proportion of variables in X that are discretised (.33, .66, 1)
- **K**: number of categories per categorical predictor (7, 5, 3, 2)
- **interval**: whether the items are discretized to be on an interval scale or not (FALSE, TRUE) 
- **npcs**: number of principal component kept. The levels of this factor were:
  - three pre-determined values: only 1 component, the true number of components (3), and the maximum number of components (12)
  - two non-graphical decision rules (acceleration factor and kaiser rule)
  - true proportion of explained variance by the true number of components (0.8)

# How to replicate results

## Running the simulation on a PC / Mac

You can also replicate the simulation on a personal computer by following these steps: 

### 1. Preparation
- Check the script `code/init.R` - 
  This script contains the information of how everything in the simulation study is set up. 
  It stores the definition of the fixed and experimental factors. Before doing anything else,
  check that every value here is what you want it to be.

### 2. Running the simulation
- Open the script `code/run_sim.R` and set your working directory to its location
- Define the number of desired repetitions by changing the parameter `reps`
- Define the number of clusters for parallelization by changing the parameter `clus`
- Run the script `code/run_sim.R`

### 3. Getting the results
- Open the script `code/script_pooling.R` and run it to pool the results. 
  Pay attention that the script is reading the latest file saved in the 
  output folder.
- Open the script `code/script_analysis.R` to obtain the plots

# Understanding the codebase
If you want to play around with this simulation study and 
include conditions of your liking keep in mind the following simulation structure:
- Fixed and experimental factors are provided exclusively by in the
  `init.R`.
- `run_sim.R` is a script that runs in parallel different calls of 
  the subroutine `doRep()` (located: `code/subroutines/doRep.R()`).
  The script calls one instance of `doRep()` for every repetition 
  desired. A *repetition* here is a cycle through all the conditions.
- `doRep()` is a subroutine that calls `runCell()` for every condition 
  in a sequential loop. 
  In this set up, parallelization happens at the level of the repetitions,
  not at the level of the conditions.
- `runCell()` is a subroutine calling a collection of functions to
  actually perform the steps of the simulation:
  1. Generation of X - `generateXTP()` generates the true principal components (T) 
     and observed items (X)
  2. Generation of y - `generateDV()` generates the dependent variable as a linear 
     combination of the true components
  3. Discretization of (part of) X - `disData()` discretizes a condition specific 
     proportion of variables in X
  4. Preparation of different version of X - Disjunction table and dummy coded representations
     of X are created
  5. PC extraction - a collection of `extractPC**()` functions performs PCA according to the 
     various approaches
  6. Outcome measures are computed - `extractMSE()` the MSE and other desired outcomes are
     extracted from previously created objects
  7. Storing results - An object containing the outcome measures is stored as .rds file 
     at every repetition for every condition in a temporary output folder.
